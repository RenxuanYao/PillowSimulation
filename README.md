# Pillow Pressure Simulation

A MATLAB toolbox for simulating pressure distribution and neck support effectiveness of various pillow shapes.

## Features
- Simulates 8 pillow shapes: Flat, Parabolic, Wave, Gaussian, Cylindrical, Conical, Asymmetric, Saddle
- Calculates key metrics:
  - Contact area
  - Average/max pressure
  - Pressure deviation
  - Neck protection score
- Real-time compression visualization

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pillow-simulation.git
